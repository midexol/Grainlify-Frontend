# Grainlify

**Grainlify** is an open-source contribution platform that connects contributors with maintainers through GitHub OAuth authentication. The platform enables developers to discover projects, track contributions, manage open-source work, and participate in ecosystem-driven initiatives.

## Features

- **GitHub OAuth Authentication** - Secure login using GitHub credentials
- **Contributor Dashboard** - Track your contributions, activity calendar, and ecosystem participation
- **Project Discovery** - Browse projects with filters for languages, ecosystems, categories, and tags
- **Maintainer Tools** - Manage projects, issues, and pull requests
- **Leaderboards & Analytics** - View contribution rankings and data insights
- **Open Source Week Events** - Participate in community events and challenges
- **Ecosystem Explorer** - Discover projects across different blockchain and tech ecosystems
- **Profile Management** - Customize your profile, notification preferences, and payout settings
- **KYC Verification** - Verify identity for rewards and payments

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS 4, Radix UI, shadcn/ui components
- **Routing:** React Router DOM 7
- **State:** React Context API
- **Charts:** Recharts, D3
- **Authentication:** GitHub OAuth with JWT
- **Package Manager:** pnpm

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v20.x or higher (LTS recommended)
- **pnpm**: Install with `npm install -g pnpm`
- **GitHub OAuth App**: Required for authentication (backend handles OAuth flow)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd grainlify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and set:
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Backend API URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080` or production URL)
   - `VITE_FRONTEND_BASE_URL`: Frontend URL (optional, defaults to `http://localhost:5173`)

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Environment Variables

All environment variables must use the `VITE_` prefix to be exposed to the client.

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Yes | Backend API base URL | `http://localhost:8080` |
| `VITE_FRONTEND_BASE_URL` | No | Frontend base URL (defaults to current origin) | `http://localhost:5173` |

## Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Sign In" or "Sign Up" (both use GitHub OAuth)
2. Frontend redirects to backend: `{VITE_API_BASE_URL}/auth/github/login/start`
3. Backend redirects to GitHub OAuth authorization
4. User authorizes Grainlify on GitHub
5. GitHub redirects to backend callback endpoint
6. Backend processes OAuth, issues JWT, and redirects to: `/auth/callback?token=<jwt>`
7. Frontend stores JWT in `localStorage` as `patchwork_jwt`
8. Frontend fetches user info from `/me` endpoint
9. User is redirected to dashboard

All authenticated API requests include: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`

## Testing

The project uses **Vitest** for unit testing with a focus on high code coverage and security verification.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
pnpm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (during development)
pnpm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
pnpm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage

The project maintains a **95% coverage threshold** for:
- Lines
- Functions
- Branches
- Statements

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory. Open `coverage/index.html` in a browser to view detailed coverage metrics.

### API Client Tests

The API client (`src/shared/api/client.ts`) has comprehensive test coverage including:

- **Authentication**: Token injection, header handling
- **Content-Type**: JSON vs FormData, CORS preflight optimization
- **Error Handling**: HTTP errors, network failures, status codes
- **Security**: Token leak prevention, console output verification
- **Edge Cases**: Empty bodies, various HTTP methods, response parsing

See [TEST_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./TEST_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed test documentation.

### Writing Tests

Tests are colocated with source files using the `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` suffix:

```
src/
├── shared/
│   └── api/
│       ├── client.ts
│       └── client.test.ts    # Tests for client.ts
```

Example test structure:
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach, vi } from 'vitest';

describe('Feature Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Arrange
    // Act
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

### Security Testing

All tests that handle authentication tokens include security assertions to ensure:
- Tokens never appear in error messages
- Tokens never appear in console logs
- Tokens are not exposed in API responses
- Token handling follows best practices

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the Patchwork backend API. All API configuration is centralized in `src/shared/config/api.ts` and uses environment variables.

See [API_INTEGRATION.md](./API_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed API documentation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure your changes:
- Follow the existing code style and architecture
- Include appropriate TypeScript types
- Maintain the glassmorphism design language
- Support both light and dark themes
- Are responsive across device sizes

## Security Notes

- **JWT Storage**: Tokens are stored in `localStorage` under the key `patchwork_jwt`
- **XSS Risk**: localStorage is vulnerable to XSS attacks; consider httpOnly cookies for production
- **OAuth Flow**: Backend handles all OAuth secrets; frontend only receives the final JWT
- **Admin Bootstrap**: `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` is a backend secret, never exposed to frontend

## Bundle Size and Analysis

To ensure that the application bundle size does not grow uncontrollably, we enforce a strict bundle budget in our CI/CD pipeline and provide tools to analyze package sizes.

### Bundle Budget

We monitor the size of the compiled **main chunk** (`dist/assets/index-*.js`). If the size exceeds the defined budget, the build pipeline will fail.

- **Baseline Main Chunk Size**: `1,732.13 KB` (approx. `1.77 MB` raw, `464.52 KB` gzipped)
- **Main Chunk Size Budget**: `1,800 KB`

### Running Local Analysis

You can generate a visual bundle analysis report to see what dependencies are consuming the most space:

1. Run the analyze script:
   ```bash
   npm run analyze
   ```
2. Open the generated report located at `dist/stats.html` in your browser. This file is automatically gitignored and will not be committed to the repository.

### Running Size Checks Locally

To manually check if the compiled bundle is within the size budget:

```bash
npm run test:bundle-size
```
